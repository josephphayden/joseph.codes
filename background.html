            Here I learnt modern development practises, AWS, PHP, Laravel. As

            While you start out studying all engineering disciplines, I later

            Master's project
          </h3>
          <p class="role-description">
            For my final year, I developed a machine-learning system to
            automatically recognise the content of films or TV shows, and then
            categorise them accordingly.
          </p>
          <p class="role-description">
            Additionally, I created a web interface for users to browse movies
            based on this categorisation, and explored ways to visualise the
            data to users.
